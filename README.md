# Photo Storage in the Cloud

This is a photo storage application backed by Bluemix Object Storage. It's built with PHP, Silex Framework, Bootstrap and HybridAuth.

## Getting Started

* Download the code from [JazzHub](https://hub.jazz.net/project/vvaswani/photos). 
* Update the Google OAuth client ID and secret in the index.php script with your own client ID and secret. 
* Download dependencies with 'php composer.phar install'.

## Bluemix Deployment
* To use the app on Bluemix, you must bind an Object Storage service instance to it and ensure that your build pack includes the PHP fileinfo extension. Refer to  [the article](#) for more information.
